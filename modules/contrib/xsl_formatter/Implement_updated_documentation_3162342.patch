+INTRODUCTION
+------------
+
+A XSL Formatter module required to be enabled a PHP XSL library
+that runs given XML content (pasted data, linked URL and uploaded
+file) through a defined XSL stylesheet before rendering.
+
+When module enabled, this provides a format as Transformed by XSL
+which is available in 'manage display' for use in content types or
+views. The result is then shown in the page and managed like any
+other field display.

+The data source can be:
+
+* A Text(plain, long) field which contains the raw XML.
+* A link field defining a remote or filesystem data source.
+* A file field where you can upload an XML file directly.
